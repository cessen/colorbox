# ColorBox

ColorBox is a low-level toolbox for working with color data.

ColorBox does NOT provide any kind of framework for doing color
management or maintaining color pipelines, it only provides the low-level
building blocks for doing color transformations.  As such, most people
probably won't want to use this crate directly.
