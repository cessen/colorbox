# ColorBox

[![Latest Release][crates-io-badge]][crates-io-url]
[![Documentation][docs-rs-img]][docs-rs-url]

A low-level toolbox for working with color.

ColorBox does NOT provide any kind of framework for doing color
management or maintaining color pipelines, it only provides the
building-block components for working with color.  As such, most people
probably won't want to use this crate directly.
